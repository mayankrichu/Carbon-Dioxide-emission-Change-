# Carbon-Dioxide-emission-Change-

A small Big Data project where we calculate the change in carbon dioxide emission between 2014 and 2004. After finding the change of CO2 emission we have mapped the change to their respective country on map. There are 6 clusters which are taken for all the countries. Countries with similar change will be assigned to that respective cluster and color.
